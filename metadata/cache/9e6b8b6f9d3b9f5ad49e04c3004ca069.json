      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two of the most significant pandemics we have experienced in the past century are the AIDS pandemic caused by HIV-1, which has been ongoing since the 1980s, and COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, which was declared a pandemic in 2020. The impact of these viruses is global and ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The virus was found to cause a respiratory illness that was later named COVID-19. The disease spread rapidly throughout the world, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 functions by infecting host cells in the throat and lungs via the ACE2 receptor on the host cells. There is no cure, but several vaccines and antiviral therapies have received emergency use authorization and now have full authorization from the FDA. More than 400 million cases and more than 6 million deaths have occurred since the onset of Covid-19 in 2020. AIDS has led to greater than 36 million deaths in total since the 1980s and almost 700 thousand deaths in just 2020. HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, functions by infecting CD4+ lymphocytes, and there is no cure or vaccine, but there are 26 FDA-approved antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs currently on the market. Although treatment has curbed the deaths worldwide of these diseases, we have not entirely eradicated these diseases. Therefore, there is a need for more effective therapeutics to help minimize this death toll, and studying these viruses is essential to getting us closer to that position. SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 are enveloped viruses that depend on a class I viral fusion protein for infection and subsequent replication. Both viruses' genomes encode a trimeric glycoprotein that mediates host cell entry. In HIV-1, this is the envelope (Env) spike glycoprotein, and in SARS-CoV-2, it is the spike (S) glycoprotein. This work seeks to elucidate the structure-function relationships of these spike proteins using molecular dynamics simulations. The goal is also to identify residues of interest that may lead to developing more potent therapeutics that span a wider range of variants by inhibiting viral entry before infection occurs. This thesis is composed of eleven chapters divided into four parts. Part one of this work provides background, motivation, and methodologies used in the following sections. An overview of viral fusion proteins is presented. Then the background of each virus, HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, is provided, including its entry mechanisms, structure, and available therapeutics. Finally, we detail the methodologies used in this work to probe each virus. Part two of this work focuses on molecular simulations of HIV-1 Env. First, specific methodologies are presented to estimate the binding free energy of known small-molecule inhibitors across HIV-1 variants. Observations are made that relate specific residue mutations to small molecule activity. Thereafter, a workflow for developing predictive activity from the SMILES structure of small molecules is proposed. The third part of this work focuses on molecular simulations of SARS-CoV-2 S. The energetics of a necessary pre-recognition conformational change are presented. Observations on the energetics of the Delta variant are also discussed. Next, the effect of specific mutations on the binding of the receptor binding domain, RBD, a subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S to ACE2, is presented. This part of the dissertation concludes by discussing the effect of temperature on SARS-CoV-2 S. The fourth part of this work reviews the conclusions, accomplishments, and impact of the presented work. This dissertation concludes by discussing the outlook and future work that could be derived as a result.</jats:p>",

DAVEI consists of a glycan-binding lectin, a flexible, polypeptide repeat unit linker and a fragment of the membrane-proximal internal region (MPER) of HIV-1 Env gp41, while DLI consists of a small molecule CD4 mimetic compound or smCD4mc, a flexible PEO repeat unit linker, and a fragment of the MPER region. The unique feature of DAVEI and DLI is the proposed mechanism, dual-engagement interaction with Env, simultaneously engaging the gp120 and gp41 regions to trigger virolysis of HIV-1 virions. DAVEI molecules proposed engagement sites are surface glycans on gp120 for the lectin and the endogenous gp41 MPER for the MPERDAVEI. DLI molecules proposed engagement sites are the CD4 binding pocket of gp120 for the smCD4mc and endogenous gp41 MPER for the DLI-MPER. For both molecules the linker generates space between the active heads of the molecule to allow for dual-engagement and is a necessary component as the active heads in mixture do not cause lysis of HIV-1 virions. In this thesis, we detail the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the mechanisms by which DAVEI and DLI molecules function including the MPERDAVEI \u00b7 MPEREnv the use of various linker lengths to generate space between active heads compared to measured distances on HIV-1 models, the generation of fitted models of DLI molecules to determine the dual-engagement capabilities of new DLI molecules given the proposed binding regions, and to understand the interaction of the DLI smCD4mc with a lipid bilayer representative of the HIV-1 virion. First, in order to assess the MPERDAVEI \u00b7 MPEREnv interaction, we considered what form this interaction would take, knowing MPEREnv forms a trimeric structure as part of HIV-1 cell entry, we hypothesized MPERDAVEI would form a mixed trimer complex with two Env MPER. We then sought to explore the stability of this structure using four amino acid point mutations via alchemical free-energy perturbation on multiple tryptophan in the structure changing them to alanine. These mutations were performed on the chain representing MPERDAVEI in the complex and the results compared to previous mutation studies of DAVEI. We found that on two of the protomers of the trimer two tryptophans (HXBc2 numbers: W666 and W672) were essential in the stability of the trimer while on the third protomer only one tryptophan (W666) was essential to the stability of the trimer. We show that this is a result of a unique placement of the W666 for this protomer which rotates the backbone of this protomer. These findings show that the unique protomer is consistent with previous DAVEI tryptophan mutation lysis studies suggesting that this model could be representative of MPERDAVEI interactions with MPEREnv trimer. Next, we used structural modelling to rationalize the dependence of DAVEI potency on the molecular length of the linker connecting the two active heads. We used temperature accelerated molecular dynamics and on-the-fly parameterization to generate free energy vs end-to-end distance for two different linker lengths, a length of zero (His6) and a length of two ([Gly4Ser]2His6). Previous studies show that DAVEI-L0 is non-lytic while DAVEI-L2 is lytic meaning that the minimum distance between the two engagement sites of DAVEI lies somewhere between DAVEI-L0 and DAVEI-L2. In addition, we generation a envelope model based on a cryo-electron microscopy-derived structure of a cleaved, soluble Env construct, with glycans added as the putative lectin engagement site and MPER added as the putative engagement site for MPERDAVEI. We used MD simulations to measure distances between the lectin C-terminus, where the linker begins, to the Env gp41, where MPERDAVEI would begin, and compared this to free energy vs end-to-end distance of the linkers. We determined that none of the glycans were close enough to MPEREnv to allow for dual-engagement of DAVEI-L0 while several would allow for DAVEI-L2 to dual engagement. These findings are consistent with previous linker length dependence studies of DAVEI and supports the proposed engagement model of DAVEI. Next, we examined the dual-engagement possibilities of DLI molecules using a model of Env and steered MD to the proposed engagement sites. We then released constraints on the system to allow the complex to relax from the engineered position to determine if dual-engagement would be maintained. We tested three different linker L1, L3 and L7 each of which were determined to be lytic. We found that all three linker lengths tested were able to maintain dual-engagement for at least one DLI on the complex although L1 required extended steered equilibration to maintain this dual-engagement which showed a high degree of flexibility in the Env structure when smaller linker lengths were used. With this model, we were able to propose that DLIs are functioning with a similar mechanism to DAVEI molecules. Finally, we examined the interaction of DLI molecules with membrane which resulted in an undesired, off-target effect. We used Umbrella Sampling and WHAM to generate a free energy vs z-distance (representative of membrane depth) for BNM-III-170 and two hydrophilic mutations of BNM-III-170 (hydroxyl-BNM-III-170 and cyano-BNM-III-170). We determined that BNM-III-170 had a minimum free energy when inserted vertically into the membrane with the hydrophobic ring embedded, while hydroxyl-BNM-III-170 still embedded in the membrane it was not to the same depth as BNM-III-170 and cyano-BNM-III-170 sat horizontally on the surface of the membrane. This supports the hypothesis that BNM-III-170 hydrophobicity is leading to an interaction with the membrane causing DLI to have an off-target effect and proposes that a hydrophilic mutation to BNM-III-170 could be used to reduce this membrane interaction and eliminate the off-target effect of DLI. Further studies should be performed on new hydrophilic BNM-III-170 structures to further decrease membrane interaction and ensure CD4 binding pocket interaction is maintained through these mutation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The authors use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate viral peptide interactions as the cause of pH-dependent fusion in liposomal drug delivery. Viral peptides (LEFN) are composed of a linker peptide (LELELELE) connected to a synthetic viral peptide (DRGWGNGCGLFGKGSI). Rather than being anchored in a lipid bilayer, the viral peptides are anchored to a neutral surface by the amino termini of the linker peptide (anchor atoms are mobile in the xy-plane). Atomistic-level peptide pair arrangement on a surface depends on pH; however, the overall propensity to cluster is independent of pH, indicating that pH-sensitive liposome fusion is not due to peptide clustering. To further investigate a molecular cause of pH-sensitive fusion, the authors treat the linker peptides as ectodomains, with the assumption that the viral peptides are already inserted into a target membrane. In these simulations, the linker peptides are elongated to encourage them to bundle. At both high and low pH, the peptides readily bundle. At high pH, however, bundling was constrained by long-range order induced by sodium ions bridging negatively charged glutamic acid residues on neighboring peptides. The authors hypothesize that this constraint hinders the ability of the linker peptides to support viral peptide insertion, resulting in decreased levels of fusion observed experimentally.</jats:p>",
