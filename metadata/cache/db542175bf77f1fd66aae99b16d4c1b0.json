HERALD constructs a Riemannian pullback manifold where Euclidean distances in latent space approximate antigenic relationships within bounded-distortion regimes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>This deposit includes:</strong></p>\n<p>* Complete theoretical framework (manuscript)<br>* Empirical validation studies on SARS-CoV-2 data:<br>&nbsp; - Validation I (DMS): Demonstrates 5.7&ndash;8.8&times; improvement in geometric separation over baseline methods on deep mutational scanning escape data across multiple antibody conditions<br>&nbsp; - Validation II-A (Time Traveler): Retrospective time-slice replay on Nextstrain genomic surveillance data; frozen encoder trained only on 2020 DMS data detects Omicron BA.1 emergence in South Africa (Z = 2.29, p &asymp; 0.011) with near-zero support-adjusted latency<br>&nbsp; - Validation II-B (Instrument Integrity): Audits structural soundness of the HERALD instrument&mdash;confirms PIT-normalized drift scores behave as calibrated Z-scores, validates threshold selection via synthetic Design Frontier analysis, and demonstrates geometric fidelity via Hamming stress test (r &gt; 0.99 linearity up to 30 mutations)<br>* Frozen encoder checkpoint (herald_dms_encoder.pt) for reproducibility<br>* Validation code, results CSVs, and visualization plots (distance histograms, traffic-light heatmaps, Design Frontier curves, manifold smoothness plots)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Contributions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Manifold Construction</strong>: Defines a contrastive learning objective with Jacobian/Laplacian regularization that induces smooth pullback metrics, enabling Euclidean computations to approximate geodesic distances reflecting antigenic divergence</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Real-Time Drift Detection</strong>: Specifies a probability-integral transform (PIT) fusion scheme combining sequence, antigenic, and structural signals into a scalar drift statistic with O(log n) amortized complexity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Formal Guarantees</strong>: Derives margin-to-separation results for InfoNCE objectives and establishes Cantelli-based probability bounds requiring only finite variance (no sub-Gaussian assumptions), composing into conditional end-to-end dominance bounds with explicit error budgets</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Protocols</strong>: Provides falsifiable protocols for retrospective time-slice replay, prospective streaming emulation, distortion audits, and equity/parity analysis across pathogens (SARS-CoV-2, influenza, HIV)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ethics Framework</strong>: Includes comprehensive governance templates addressing dual-use risks, information hazards, data sovereignty, abstention policies, and oversight structures</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Empirical Validation:</strong> Validation I demonstrates 5.7&ndash;8.8&times; improvement in geometric separation (&Delta;) over baseline methods on SARS-CoV-2 deep mutational scanning data. Validation II confirms out-of-time generalization: the frozen encoder detects Omicron BA.1 emergence in South Africa (Z = 2.29, p &asymp; 0.011) under sparse monthly surveillance data with near-zero support-adjusted latency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scope</strong>: The theoretical manuscript presents definitions, assumptions, theorems, and evaluation protocols. Validation I provides empirical confirmation on historical DMS data; Validation II demonstrates real-world surveillance applicability via retrospective time-slice replay on Nextstrain genomic data. Both studies use rigorous train/test methodology and no sequence optimization (safe surveillance scope). Applications extend beyond viral surveillance to bacterial pathogen monitoring (STEC, antibiotic resistance) where antigenic/functional divergence precedes clinical detection.</p>\n<p><strong>Author</strong>: Bee Rosa Davis (NASA Mission Systems Engineer, IBM X-Force Red Principal Adversarial Intelligence Engineer)</p>\n<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: viral surveillance, Riemannian geometry, contrastive learning, immune escape, early warning systems, algorithmic epidemiology, information geometry, public health AI, ESM-2, protein language models, deep mutational scanning</p>\n<p><strong>License and Patent Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Copyright License</strong>:</em> This work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

        "description": "<p>Sericulture is a labour-intensive textile industry that involves growing food plants for silkworms, raising them, reeling their silk, and performing various post-cocoon operations, including twisting, dying, weaving, printing, and finishing. It employs a huge number of rural people; the majority are small and marginal farmers or work in the tiny and home sector, mostly in the hand reeling and hand weaving sections. Despite the fact that silk is of natural origin, the silk industry uses some health-hazardous substances at all stages from mulberry farming through silk fabric finishing. Pesticides, fungicides, nematicides, bactericides, and herbicides are the most common in mulberry cultivation. Similar to mulberry agrochemicals, the pre-cocoon industry employs a wide range of disinfectants and bed disinfectants to protect the silkworm crop against infections. And also, a separate class of agrochemicals is utilised in dyeing, printing, and washing because it improves the reeling process and silk quality. However, these compounds create respiratory issues and are carcinogenic to humans, as indicated by dermatitis, skin lesions, back aches, bronchial asthma, coughs, gastrointestinal pains, ulcers, throat infections, thinning nails, dry skin, and hand and eye burning. In addition to human concerns, persistent chemicals endanger the ecosystem and contribute to the overall chemicalization of aquatic and terrestrial environments. As a result, whenever possible, the discharge of toxic compounds into the natural environment should be reduced. Unfortunately, in developing countries like India, where large quantities of these chemicals are generated and dumped into the environment, they are not properly managed because little is known about their potential risks and benefits if properly managed. In this article, we intend to explore the major sources of sericulture agrochemicals, their potential risks, and how they can be properly managed.</p>\n<p>published by the <a href=\"https://innspub.net/journal-of-biodiversity-and-environmental-sciences/\"><strong>Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences | JBES</strong></a></p>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>",

        "description": "<p><strong>This Zenodo record is a permanently preserved version of a PREreview. You can view the complete PREreview at <a href=\"https://prereview.org/reviews/17773507\">https://prereview.org/reviews/17773507</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The electron is re-examined as a single electromagnetic wave that closes upon itself with a half-twist, forming a M\u00f6bius ribbon whose circumference equals one reduced Compton wavelength. This topological closure traps the invariant rest-energy and forces the field to return to its initial phase only after a 4\u03c0 rotation, reproducing spin one-half without invoking abstract spinors. Adding an integer number <i>N</i> of radial nodes generates a standing-wave ladder where frequency and radius scale as <i>f<sub>N</sub></i> = <i>f<sub>0</sub></i>/(<i>N</i> +1) and <i>r<sub>N</sub></i> = (<i>N</i> +1)<i>r<sub>inner</sub></i>. The ladder matches the Bohr--Rydberg spectrum when <i>n=N+1</i> and links the fine-structure constant to the Compton--Bohr radius ratio <i>\u03b1</i> = <i>r<sub>inner</sub></i>/<i>a<sub>0</sub></i>. We give a concrete sketch for the Schwinger anomaly from core--envelope interference and outline how point-like scattering can coexist with a finite geometric core. The geometry yields two near-term tests: an <i>enhanced h</i>/2<i>e</i> harmonic in mesoscopic Aharonov--Bohm rings (with the usual <i>h</i>/<i>e</i> present but relatively suppressed in a specific regime), and a forward-Compton form-factor minimum at a momentum transfer set by <i>Qr<sub>inner</sub></i>\u2248 <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> with <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> the first Bessel zero (<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> \u2248 2.4048), i.e. <i>Q</i> \u2243 1.2 MeV/c to 1.6 MeV/c depending on the aperture kernel (ring-like <i>J<sub>0</sub></i> vs spherical sinc). We also streamline the orbital taxonomy (S,P,D,...) as <i>emergent angular families</i> from azimuthal node counts; the music-note analogy is offered only as a light heuristic.</p>\n\n    <h2>Competing interests</h2>\n\n    <p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p>\n\n    <h2>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>\n\n    <p>The authors declare that they did not use generative AI to come up with new ideas for their review.</p>",
