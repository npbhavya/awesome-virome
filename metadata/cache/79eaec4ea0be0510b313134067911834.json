        "description": "<p>Human peer review was an effective technique to address quality, originality, and errors of non-LLM generated work. Researcher-AI trust has since then grown due to performant large language model (LLM) benchmark improvements and author implementations across different model manufacturers for processing frequent, complex, and voluminous data. This single human-AI team has led to the emergence of readily available artificial intelligence peer review. A primary benefit of AI peer review is the ability to appropriately conduct iterative analyses and corrections throughout the entire manuscript process. This responsible method improves on over-worked and fatigued human recommendations provided after manuscript completion. Here, a maximum efficiency study was performed in 14 days with the author utilizing a prior glioblastoma clinical trial matching guidance and a TrialGPT paper as inputs to output a prompt for developing a Python deep learning pipeline. A 10 file dataset and clinical BERT model notebook were generated by Sonnet 4.5 Extended, followed by repetitions of code fixes and optimizations to yield a final notebook at a low test set performance of 67.3%. A triple AI peer review conducted by Sonnet, GPT 5.1, and Grok 4.1 all yielded the primary recommendation to upgrade to a tabular model, which was more suitable for the csv dataset.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT then identified the most appropriate selection: an open source TabPFN-v2-clf model from Hugging Face. The Sonnet recommendations also included detailed instruction for five-fold cross-validation, SHAP explainability, and bias analysis incorporation. An AI peer review evaluation standard for ML workflows based criterion and efficiency metrics was generated by Opus 4.5 with highest efficiencies based on the least number of humans, prompts, and time at the lowest LLM cost. Subsequent evaluation of the current workflow with an overall quality of 87.5%, and 0.831 efficiency based on human, prompt, time, and cost metrics. The ChatGPT identified model and Sonnet review instructions were implemented into the prior notebook to yield a new notebook that saw an acceleration in research progress with a test set accuracy improvement to 94.0% with few-shot learning along with peer review corrections. A regulatory compliance prompt was created, followed by full document generations of FDA 21 CFR Part 820, ICH-GCP E6(R2), and ISO 14971 addressing quality, clinical practice, and risk management. Several attempts to create an effective FastAPI code repository by Sonnet were initially unsuccessful, however an Opus/Sonnet prompting strategy yielded a FastAPI interface with three successful glioblastoma patient clinical trial match predictions. AI as a senior software engineer and as a senior regulatory analyst were also employed as part of the AI peer review process</p>\n<p>The purpose of this AI peer review study was to place the world&rsquo;s focus back on innovating active and real world medical AI advancements in a fraction of the time. Measuring the effect AI implementation has on large workforces can be challenging to quantify. The conversational human-AI R&amp;D relationship has become increasingly solitude: therefore this single author project should be viewed as the standard for new workflows going into the future. This next evolution of peer review is especially suitable for hard working researchers in less favorable economic, educational, and affiliation conditions, such as the author of the paper. This process is afforded by low cost, fast, and easy to use state of the art LLMs from Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI; marking the pivot away from slow and irresponsible use of human peer review for LLM-generated data, and back to fast automation of patient health applications at scale. Many authors of less influence can now improve their speed of development and gain reputation in papers by simply providing prompts, LLMs, AI peer review recommendations, and corrections they made - without the need for paid review or journals. Interested parties can then view the author&rsquo;s peer review findings alongside the paper. Trust for the AI peer review process was established over a series of human-AI works reflected in LLM code and non-code benchmarking, applications in literature, and prior author works using AI in review roles coordinated across judging, external validation, cross-verification, meta-verification, and tests according to FDA/ICH guidance.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Applying potential foliar fertilizer for mungbean at the best time can help farmers increase their yield and, subsequently, their income. Hence, the study was conducted to determine the growth, yield, and root nodulation performance of mungbean as influenced by the time of spraying irradiated carrageenan. The study was conducted at Candon City, Ilocos Sur, Philippines from January to May 2021 employing Randomized Complete Block Design with three blocks. The experimental treatments were as follows: T0: no application (control); T1: spraying at 6 a.m.; T2: spraying at 7 a.m.; T3: spraying at 8 a.m.; T4: spraying at 3 p.m.; T5: spraying at 4 p.m.; and T6: spraying at 7 p.m. The result of the study revealed significant differences in terms of survival rate (%), but no significant differences were noted in terms of number of days to emergence, flowering, and maturity, plant height at maturity (cm), number of pods per plant, length of the pod (cm), number of seeds per pod, weight of 100 seeds (g), plant growth and vigor, nodule abundance and color, nodule position, and effective nodulation assessment. Spraying of irradiated carrageenan at 8 a.m. produced the highest seed yield per hectare (2514.00kg) however, did not vary significantly with other spraying times. It was noted that spraying irradiated carrageenan can increase the yield of mungbean by 9.95% to 28.57%. The result suggests that irradiated carrageenan can be sprayed early in the morning (6 a.m. to 8 a.m.) and late in the afternoon to early evening (3 p.m. to 7 p.m.) by the farmers in the locality. Seed inoculation should also be done by the farmers to improve the root nodulation of mungbean plants.</p>\n<p>published by the<a href=\"Foliar fertilizer, Irradiated carrageenan, Mungbean, Root nodulation, Seed yield, Spraying time\">&nbsp; <strong>Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences | JBES</strong></a></p>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>",

        "description": "<p>Investment in physical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, airports, sea ports, water ports, railways etc., is a fundamental ingredient in the growth and economic development of a country. Compared to countries like Singapore, South Korea and China, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have significantly underinvested in infrastructure over the years, resulting in stunted growth. Zambia, which has a large infrastructure funding gap, and a ballooning government debt, cannot rely solely on the government to meet its infrastructure funding needs. This study looked at establishment of a strategic financing mechanism for sustained construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads- a case of Lusaka district. The study adopted pragmatism philosophy, focusing on practical, real-world outcomes. It combined quantitative and qualitative methods to address establishment of a strategic financing mechanism for sustained construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads (Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2010). A mixed-methods approach was used, integrating both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups) explored strategic mechanism of sustained financing for construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads, while quantitative surveys measured ways of sustaining the financing for construction and maintenance of the public roads This approach provided a comprehensive understanding of how to have a strategic mechanism to fund the construction and maintenance of public roads in Zambia (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2017). The study applied both deductive and inductive approaches. Data collected was analysed using the Dedose Software for the qualitative part and for the quantitative part a thematic analysis was used to come up with the results. Zambia has in place legal and institutional frameworks (Tembo, 2015) that are necessary for effective and efficient road asset management. This study established that a number of financing strategies or frame works for road construction and maintenance such as RoadSIP 1 and II and RoadSIP III (yet to be launched), performed fairly well albeit some challenges. It also established that most road projects under implementation are under the government&rsquo;s balance sheet and that, the Road sector&rsquo;s indebtedness to local Contractors and Consultants was increasing and the financing gap was widening. Zambia would need to spend an average of $1.6 billion a year over the decade 2022&ndash;30 to develop the infrastructure found in the rest of the developing world (Foster and Dominguez, 2010). To close this financial gap required raising more funds and looking for more effective ways to meet infrastructure targets. The study established that since traditional funding methods for road construction and maintenance in Zambia such as tax revenues and loans are becoming unsustainable, there is need to look for other alternatives. The study established the potential strategic sources of funding for sustained construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads include public private partnerships, equity financing, road tolls and establishment of a State Infrastructure Bank(s). The study also established a Strategic Road Financing Framework (SRFFW) that clearly illustrates the interconnection between institutional governance, revenue diversification, community engagement, and sustainability. To Address financing challenges, it was recommended that there is need to increase Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) by inviting the private sector to participate in the construction, maintenance, and financing of roads.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em><span lang=\"EN\">Phishing sites still cause big problems online, often resulting in stolen money, leaked info, or fake identities being created. Older detection methods use only machine learning or fixed rules, which makes them less accurate and slow during live use. Instead, this study introduces a mixed approach combining smart algorithms with practical URL checks that work instantly. The system tests five types - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, along with K-Nearest Neighbors - using a known public set of phishing links. A quick heuristic tool checks URL structure - then an advanced mix layer decides the outcome. Tests show this combined method beats single models by being more accurate and stable. On top of that, a live web app built with Streamlit lets users test any URL, complete with confidence levels and clear feature insights. The project boosts clarity, real-world use, and trust in spotting today's phishing attempts.</span></em></p>",

        "description": "<p>This work develops a modified model of the solar interior where the effective spatial dimension of the core varies smoothly with radius. A scale-dependent dimensional profile is introduced into the Lane&ndash;Emden equation, producing small localized changes in hydrostatic structure while keeping the global solar mass and radius unchanged.</p>\n<p>Using this approach, the study computes modified polytropic solutions, evaluates changes in solar neutrino production (pp, pep, Be-7, and B-8 channels), and compares the results with modern experimental flux measurements. A full parameter scan identifies a region of solutions that match all major neutrino flux ratios with very good accuracy. The best-fit model achieves a reduced chi-square of about 0.16 and predicts a central temperature shift of only about 0.3 to 0.4 percent relative to the Standard Solar Model.</p>\n<p>A simple helioseismic comparison shows that the dimensional modification produces sound-speed deviations of less than 0.2 percent across the solar radius, remaining consistent with observational constraints.</p>\n<p>The included Python code provides the modified Lane&ndash;Emden solver, neutrino integration routines, solar calibration, helioseismic comparison, and parameter scanning tools. Overall, this project demonstrates that very small, smooth changes in effective dimensionality can influence nuclear reaction rates and neutrino fluxes while preserving the overall structure of the Sun.</p>",

        "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This study presents a computational methodology for identifying shared vocabulary between English and Spanish to support second language acquisition. Similarity indexes (S.I.) were calculated to determine the percentage of orthographic and semantic overlap between the two languages.</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Both Spanish and English use the Roman script, which allowed for string-based comparison. English has received multiple loanwords from Latin, from which Spanish also derives. This study analyses the most frequent vocabulary in both languages to assess the similarity level and extract similar lexical items. The results show that a lexical similarity level of 53.13% corresponding to 1594 shared lexical terms</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">was calculated using a lexico-statistical computational method to compare the 3000 highest frequency terms of the basic vocabulary of English and Spanish, identifying shared vocabulary as a pedagogical tool.</span></p>",
