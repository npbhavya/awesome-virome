Buckwheat (<em>Fagopyrum esculentum</em> Moench) has been neglected but is regaining popularity due to its short duration and low input for growing. Its floor has the characteristics closely related to bread wheat, hence it is an alternate choice for consumption by the humans. In addition to its nutritional properties, the buckwheat also has quite a few health benefits.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong>&nbsp;Tuberous sclerosis is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by a mutation in either the&nbsp;<em>TSC1</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>TSC2</em>&nbsp;genes, with a global incidence ranging from 1 in every 6,000 to 10,000 newborns. Its pathophysiological mechanism is not fully understood; however, it is known that the&nbsp;<em>TSC1</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>TSC2</em>&nbsp;genes encode the proteins hamartin and tuberin, which form a complex that regulates mTOR, considered a key pathway in controlling cell growth. Clinical manifestations include cutaneous, neurological, cardiac, and renal abnormalities, among which the development of benign and/or malignant renal tumors stands out&mdash;particularly angiomyolipoma or clear cell renal carcinoma.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>CLINICAL CASE:</strong>&nbsp;A 31-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with generalized abdominal pain (VAS 8/10) radiating to the right iliac fossa, unresponsive to analgesics, and accompanied by changes in bowel habits, fever, and a 20-kilogram weight loss over one month. A diagnostic work-up was performed, documenting a right renal tumor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is known to predispose individuals to the formation of benign tumors in any organ of the body, with corresponding clinical consequences. However, the development of clear cell renal carcinoma is a rare finding, as most renal tumors in these patients tend to be angiomyolipomas, which are benign in the vast majority of cases.</p>",

The experimental treatments were as follows: T0: no application (control); T1: spraying at 6 a.m.; T2: spraying at 7 a.m.; T3: spraying at 8 a.m.; T4: spraying at 3 p.m.; T5: spraying at 4 p.m.; and T6: spraying at 7 p.m. The result of the study revealed significant differences in terms of survival rate (%), but no significant differences were noted in terms of number of days to emergence, flowering, and maturity, plant height at maturity (cm), number of pods per plant, length of the pod (cm), number of seeds per pod, weight of 100 seeds (g), plant growth and vigor, nodule abundance and color, nodule position, and effective nodulation assessment. Spraying of irradiated carrageenan at 8 a.m. produced the highest seed yield per hectare (2514.00kg) however, did not vary significantly with other spraying times. It was noted that spraying irradiated carrageenan can increase the yield of mungbean by 9.95% to 28.57%. The result suggests that irradiated carrageenan can be sprayed early in the morning (6 a.m. to 8 a.m.) and late in the afternoon to early evening (3 p.m. to 7 p.m.) by the farmers in the locality. Seed inoculation should also be done by the farmers to improve the root nodulation of mungbean plants.</p>\n<p>published by the<a href=\"Foliar fertilizer, Irradiated carrageenan, Mungbean, Root nodulation, Seed yield, Spraying time\">&nbsp; <strong>Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences | JBES</strong></a></p>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>",

        "description": "<p>I report the first larval host plant record for the rare and protected noctuid moth Dioszeghyana schmidtii (Dioszeghy, 1935) in Greece. Two larvae were observed feeding on Valonia oak Quercus ithaburensis subsp. macrolepis in a fire-affected Mediterranean oak forest north of Alexandroupoli, Evros (northeastern Greece), representing a previously undocumented host plant association for this species. This finding expands the known ecological amplitude of D. schmidtii, whose biology remains largely unknown despite its inclusion in Annexes II and IV of the EU Habitats Directive. The finding occurred near a Natura 2000 site recently affected by the catastrophic wildfires of 2023, highlighting the importance of post-fire monitoring for rare Lepidoptera. This short communication contributes to the biological knowledge and conservation planning of D. schmidtii and underscores the need for further ecological study of early life stages in noctuid moths of conservation concern.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Even though technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain have the potential to help solve privacy problems, they can't be used by themselves. This paper looks at how these technologies can work together to make decentralized defense systems that are more powerful. Many security jobs, like finding malware, analyzing fraud, and stopping intrusions, have been taken over by AI technologies like machine learning and deep learning. But these solutions are centralized and make decisions in a way that is hard to understand. Lack of openness also leads to problems with who owns and controls data. Blockchain, on the other hand, makes it possible for independent peer-to-peer networks that are protected by cryptography. Some use cases are digital identity, distributed access control, and logs that can be checked. On the other hand, blockchain by itself doesn't have the intelligence needed for advanced threat research. The processing power of AI and the spread trust model of blockchain can work together to make up for each other's flaws. A decentralized threat intelligence tool that uses machine learning on an open blockchain network can give partners security insights that can work together and that can be explained and rewarded. AI is also used to look at audit trails and consensus processes on the blockchain in order to learn new attack patterns all the time. Trusted digital identity solutions that use biometrics, AI, and smart contracts on blockchain can also make managing access easier and stop identity theft. To get the most out of this unified approach, problems with privacy, scale, and interoperability need to be fixed with methods such as federated learning, off-chain processing, and encryption. Through the decentralized combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies, this synergy could turn cybersecurity into a system that is open, democratic, and accountable by design.</p>",

        "description": "<p><span>This study examines the comparative Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) frameworks applied to biologics and pharmaceuticals, specifically messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines and gene therapies, across the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Biologics and advanced therapies present unique manufacturing and distribution challenges due to their complexity, sensitivity to environmental conditions, and reliance on high-integrity cold-chain systems. Using a comparative case study methodology supported by Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), this research evaluates how regulatory agencies manage risks related to production, quality assurance, and distribution. Findings indicate that harmonized risk management practices grounded in International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Q9 (Quality Risk Management) and Q10 (Pharmaceutical Quality System) principles can reduce supply disruptions by approximately 30% and improve compliance outcomes. The study highlights the growing emphasis on data integrity, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance, and cross-border cooperation, especially under emergency pathways such as the FDA&rsquo;s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and EMA&rsquo;s accelerated approval.</span></p>",

MALDI N-glycan TIF images are in the glycan subfolder. TIF images of each annotation mask region are in the mask subfolder. Annotations are labelled by DBDP_[donor gestational age]_[region#]. Raw intensity of N-glycans in each mask region can be found in the glycan_data.csv table.</li>\n<li><strong>DBDP_histology.zip</strong> contains high resolution H&amp;E and HLA-G IHC slide scans of decidual DB/DP whole tissue sections from 3 donor samples. Each patient sample is labelled DBDP_[donor gestational age].</li>\n<li><strong>EVT_glycans.zip</strong> contains N-glycomic imaging data and annotation masks of trophoblast regions in decidual tissue microarray (TMA) constructed from 66 donor samples. MALDI N-glycan TIF images are in the glycan_registered subfolder. Annotation mask images are in the mask_registered subfolder. High resolution H&amp;E and HLA-G immunofluorescence scans of the TMA can be found in HnE.ndpi and HLAG_Nuclear_IF.tif respectively. Raw intensity of N-glycans in each mask region can be found in the glycan_data.csv table.</li>\n<li><strong>EVT_transcript.zip</strong> contains Nanostring GeoMx transcriptomics data from selected trophoblast regions of interest in the decidual TMA. Normalized transcript counts are enumerated in normalized_expression.csv, and metadata of regions of interests can be found in metadata.csv. High resolution image of regions of interest overlayed on immunofluorescence staining of morphology markers can in found in overlay_ROI_morphology.png</li>\n<li><strong>proteomics_glycoproteomics.zip</strong> contains processed data for proteomics, deglycoproteomics and EBG-treated glycoproteomics of 5 pairs of patient-matched DB and DP samples. Each data table includes gene names, modified peptide sequence (for deglyco- and glycoproteomics data), log2 intensities in each sample and t-test/limma statistics of each protein or glycopeptide.</li>\n</ul>",
