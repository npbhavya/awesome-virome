    "abstract": "MOTIVATION\nNot only sequence data continue to outpace annotation information, but also the problem is further exacerbated when organisms are underrepresented in the annotation databases. This is the case with non-human-pathogenic viruses which occur frequently in metagenomic projects. Thus, there is a need for tools capable of detecting and classifying viral sequences.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe describe VIRALpro a new effective tool for identifying capsid and tail protein sequences, which are the cornerstones toward viral sequence annotation and viral genome classification.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThe data, software and corresponding web server are available from http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu as part of the SCRATCH suite.\n\n\nCONTACT\nclovis.galiez@inria.fr or pfbaldi@uci.edu\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
