        "description": "<p>The success of the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt has fueled anti-government movements within Syrian civilian groups and encouraged the formation of rebel groups aimed at ending the Al-Assad regime. The escalating war has shaped perceptions regarding the war strategy used by the Al-Assad regime in dealing with the rebellion. In 2018, Annie Sparrow, Associate Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, wrote an article regarding allegations of Al-Assad's use of biological weapons during the Syrian civil war. Despite these allegations of the use of biological weapons, there has been no official statement or policy issued by international organizations in response to Al-Assad's war strategy during the Syrian civil war. Therefore, this study will address the question of \"why can Bashar Al Assad's biological strategy be categorized as biological warfare?\" To determine whether Al-Assad's strategy can be categorized as biological warfare, this study will use the concept of biological warfare by Mark Wheelis, Lajos R&oacute;zsa, and Malcolm Dando. This study found that the use of biological weapons in the Al-Assad regime's war strategy has fulfilled the three main factors shaping the perception of allegations of the use of biological weapons in the Syrian civil war.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Investment in physical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, airports, sea ports, water ports, railways etc., is a fundamental ingredient in the growth and economic development of a country. Compared to countries like Singapore, South Korea and China, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have significantly underinvested in infrastructure over the years, resulting in stunted growth. Zambia, which has a large infrastructure funding gap, and a ballooning government debt, cannot rely solely on the government to meet its infrastructure funding needs. This study looked at establishment of a strategic financing mechanism for sustained construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads- a case of Lusaka district. The study adopted pragmatism philosophy, focusing on practical, real-world outcomes. It combined quantitative and qualitative methods to address establishment of a strategic financing mechanism for sustained construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads (Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2010). A mixed-methods approach was used, integrating both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups) explored strategic mechanism of sustained financing for construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads, while quantitative surveys measured ways of sustaining the financing for construction and maintenance of the public roads This approach provided a comprehensive understanding of how to have a strategic mechanism to fund the construction and maintenance of public roads in Zambia (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2017). The study applied both deductive and inductive approaches. Data collected was analysed using the Dedose Software for the qualitative part and for the quantitative part a thematic analysis was used to come up with the results. Zambia has in place legal and institutional frameworks (Tembo, 2015) that are necessary for effective and efficient road asset management. This study established that a number of financing strategies or frame works for road construction and maintenance such as RoadSIP 1 and II and RoadSIP III (yet to be launched), performed fairly well albeit some challenges. It also established that most road projects under implementation are under the government&rsquo;s balance sheet and that, the Road sector&rsquo;s indebtedness to local Contractors and Consultants was increasing and the financing gap was widening. Zambia would need to spend an average of $1.6 billion a year over the decade 2022&ndash;30 to develop the infrastructure found in the rest of the developing world (Foster and Dominguez, 2010). To close this financial gap required raising more funds and looking for more effective ways to meet infrastructure targets. The study established that since traditional funding methods for road construction and maintenance in Zambia such as tax revenues and loans are becoming unsustainable, there is need to look for other alternatives. The study established the potential strategic sources of funding for sustained construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads include public private partnerships, equity financing, road tolls and establishment of a State Infrastructure Bank(s). The study also established a Strategic Road Financing Framework (SRFFW) that clearly illustrates the interconnection between institutional governance, revenue diversification, community engagement, and sustainability. To Address financing challenges, it was recommended that there is need to increase Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) by inviting the private sector to participate in the construction, maintenance, and financing of roads.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Achieving semantic interoperability in distributed healthcare systems is a global challenge, especially in low-resource settings such as Kenya. Inconsistent implementation of electronic health record (EHR) standards hinders semantic interoperability by limiting the ability of distributed healthcare systems to exchange and interpret data with shared, unambiguous meaning. This study evaluates the influence of EHR standards on semantic interoperability in distributed health systems in Kenya. A mixed-method approach using descriptive and correlational research design was adopted, targeting four Level 5 public hospitals with 301 sampled respondents including system developers, health practitioners, and administrators. Statistical analyses confirmed a very weak but statistically significant correlation between EHR standards and semantic interoperability (Spearman&rsquo;s &rho; = 0.007, p = 0.04, N = 268). Additionally, the Kruskal-Walli&rsquo;s test revealed significant differences in semantic interoperability across low, medium, and high EHR adoption groups (H-Statistic = 6.52, p = 0.038), with high adopters demonstrating the highest mean rank (148.92). However, mediation analysis indicated that system usability does not significantly mediate the relationship between EHR standards and semantic interoperability (Indirect effect = -0.0004, 95% CI [-0.0125, 0.0097]). Findings highlight that EHR standards alone have limited impact, and greater interoperability gains depend on integrated approaches combining standards with usability, governance, and technical alignment.</p>",

HERALD constructs a Riemannian pullback manifold where Euclidean distances in latent space approximate antigenic relationships within bounded-distortion regimes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>This deposit includes:</strong></p>\n<p>* Complete theoretical framework (manuscript)<br>* Empirical validation studies on SARS-CoV-2 data:<br>&nbsp; - Validation I (DMS): Demonstrates 5.7&ndash;8.8&times; improvement in geometric separation over baseline methods on deep mutational scanning escape data across multiple antibody conditions<br>&nbsp; - Validation II-A (Time Traveler): Retrospective time-slice replay on Nextstrain genomic surveillance data; frozen encoder trained only on 2020 DMS data detects Omicron BA.1 emergence in South Africa (Z = 2.29, p &asymp; 0.011) with near-zero support-adjusted latency<br>&nbsp; - Validation II-B (Instrument Integrity): Audits structural soundness of the HERALD instrument&mdash;confirms PIT-normalized drift scores behave as calibrated Z-scores, validates threshold selection via synthetic Design Frontier analysis, and demonstrates geometric fidelity via Hamming stress test (r &gt; 0.99 linearity up to 30 mutations)<br>* Frozen encoder checkpoint (herald_dms_encoder.pt) for reproducibility<br>* Validation code, results CSVs, and visualization plots (distance histograms, traffic-light heatmaps, Design Frontier curves, manifold smoothness plots)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Contributions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Manifold Construction</strong>: Defines a contrastive learning objective with Jacobian/Laplacian regularization that induces smooth pullback metrics, enabling Euclidean computations to approximate geodesic distances reflecting antigenic divergence</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Real-Time Drift Detection</strong>: Specifies a probability-integral transform (PIT) fusion scheme combining sequence, antigenic, and structural signals into a scalar drift statistic with O(log n) amortized complexity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Formal Guarantees</strong>: Derives margin-to-separation results for InfoNCE objectives and establishes Cantelli-based probability bounds requiring only finite variance (no sub-Gaussian assumptions), composing into conditional end-to-end dominance bounds with explicit error budgets</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Protocols</strong>: Provides falsifiable protocols for retrospective time-slice replay, prospective streaming emulation, distortion audits, and equity/parity analysis across pathogens (SARS-CoV-2, influenza, HIV)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ethics Framework</strong>: Includes comprehensive governance templates addressing dual-use risks, information hazards, data sovereignty, abstention policies, and oversight structures</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Empirical Validation:</strong> Validation I demonstrates 5.7&ndash;8.8&times; improvement in geometric separation (&Delta;) over baseline methods on SARS-CoV-2 deep mutational scanning data. Validation II confirms out-of-time generalization: the frozen encoder detects Omicron BA.1 emergence in South Africa (Z = 2.29, p &asymp; 0.011) under sparse monthly surveillance data with near-zero support-adjusted latency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scope</strong>: The theoretical manuscript presents definitions, assumptions, theorems, and evaluation protocols. Validation I provides empirical confirmation on historical DMS data; Validation II demonstrates real-world surveillance applicability via retrospective time-slice replay on Nextstrain genomic data. Both studies use rigorous train/test methodology and no sequence optimization (safe surveillance scope). Applications extend beyond viral surveillance to bacterial pathogen monitoring (STEC, antibiotic resistance) where antigenic/functional divergence precedes clinical detection.</p>\n<p><strong>Author</strong>: Bee Rosa Davis (NASA Mission Systems Engineer, IBM X-Force Red Principal Adversarial Intelligence Engineer)</p>\n<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: viral surveillance, Riemannian geometry, contrastive learning, immune escape, early warning systems, algorithmic epidemiology, information geometry, public health AI, ESM-2, protein language models, deep mutational scanning</p>\n<p><strong>License and Patent Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Copyright License</strong>:</em> This work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

To expose common historical explanations that authorize men and treat them as much less important than women, this assignment gives to the field of religion and gender as shown in holy and inaccessible texts. The women are thought as humbler and more respectful in religious books. Educated people review institutional practices, such as not including women from leadership positions in religion, and use related to feeling that women and men must be treated equally studying to uncover biases in standard texts. This study's main goal is to critically cut apart the gender stories that are in a detailed way woven into holy and untouchable writings. The information and concepts included in this article were gathered from Holy Quran, Sayings of Prophet, Islamic literature books and literature available in different online sources. All religions have certain features and, are shaped by the social big picture in which they are practiced and provide personal guidelines that in some way stop a quality that makes something stand-alone or look different. Groups who are treated as much less important, including single women, are the most important examples of how real experiences differ from popular explanations. All things thought about research on the relationship between religion and male and female status provides important information about the complex patterns that exist inside religious contexts as well as the related to things slowly changing for the better over time paths of social change. Using a related feeling that women and men must be treated equally and an intersectional solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built, this way of doing things tries to a lot of changes academically to understand and enable big changes in religious and institutional normal behaviors at the local and worldwide levels. For a complete understanding of complex issues, the long and high-quality act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something is necessary. This emerging field has the ability to fundamentally alter institutional and religious structures globally by purposefully elevating marginalized perspectives and employing participatory research methods.</p>",

        "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Digital story telling is a modern and effective method used in teaching English, combining traditional storytelling techniques with digital tools such as videos, images, audio recordings, and interactive media. This approach engages students actively, enhances their language skills, and fosters creativity and critical thinking. By integrating technology into language learning, teachers can create more dynamic and interactive lessons that cater to different learning styles. Digital story telling encourages students to construct narratives, express ideas clearly, and practice vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation in meaningful contexts. It also promotes collaboration and communication among students, as they often work in groups to create digital stories. This method is particularly significant in the<span>&nbsp; </span>classroom, where digital literacy is as important as language proficiency. Research shows that students who participate in digital story telling activities demonstrate improved motivation, retention, and overall language competence. Thus, digital story telling is not only a tool for language acquisition but also a way to prepare students for a digital and interconnected world.</span></p>",

        "description": "<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>\n<p>We present <em>Quantum Prime Spectral Theory</em> (QPST), an operator-theoretic framework that encodes prime powers and Archimedean contributions into a single phase&ndash;arithmetic Hamiltonian.<br>The construction combines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a discrete arithmetical block <strong>K_arit = diag(k &middot; log p)</strong>,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>an Archimedean continuous block weighted by the Bose&ndash;Einstein type measure <strong>(e^(2&pi;&lambda;) &minus; 1)^(-1) d&lambda;</strong>,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and a global Fourier mixing unitary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resulting Hamiltonian</p>\n<p><strong>H(T) = (1/2) &middot; ( M \u2218 U_phys(T) + h.c. )</strong></p>\n<p>is explicitly self-adjoint, has purely discrete spectrum, and satisfies a trace identity reproducing the classical explicit formula for the Riemann zeta function.<br>Using this identity, we derive the Riemann&ndash;von Mangoldt asymptotics and prove a spectral rigidity theorem showing that the spectrum of H(T) coincides with the imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros of &zeta;(s).</p>\n<p>Numerical experiments with <strong>6000 verified Riemann zeros</strong> confirm the operator&rsquo;s spectral behaviour, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GOE nearest-neighbour statistics,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Montgomery pair correlation,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a globally aligned spectral form factor indistinguishable from that of the Riemann zeros,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and stability across multiple spectral windows.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This provides a fully explicit and analytically consistent candidate for a Hilbert&ndash;P&oacute;lya operator.</p>\n<p><em>(Parts I through X appear in the previous version.)</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Note: My addres is actually charlescgj@ufmg.br</em></p>",
