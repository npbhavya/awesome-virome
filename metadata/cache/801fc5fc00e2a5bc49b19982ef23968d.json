    "title": "Software toolkit for evaluating infrared imaging seeker",
    "abstract": "Modern infrared imaging seekers can nowadays deal with higher resolution and less noisy sensor images. The testing of new image processing or tracking algorithms requires a fitted set of relevant sensor images. When no actual recordings are available, when experimental benches are not adapted or at an early stage of development, one can require a simulation tool to generate synthetic infrared sensor images. This paper presents the first version of ISISserver (Infrared Sensor Image Simulation Server) a software library developed at TNO and used for infrared (IR) imaging seeker applications. Based on the EOSTAR Pro (Electro-Optical Signal Transmission And Ranging) model suite, the set of functions offered by this toolkit allows analysis of synthetic sensor images generated for various synthetic environments and targets. Typical targets from a database can be used as well as externally user designed 3D targets. Simulation results using ISISserver toolkit with test data (not realistic or physical data) will be shown.",
