If that is a problem for your execution - stick to VirSorter1, please)\r\n- Output directory re-structure, added flag `--publish_all` to produce expanded output.\r\n- A few fixes on the plots\r\n- Optimised performance when running HMMER against the viphog DB.\r\n- Updated CheckV to v1.0.1\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n* Update README.md by @cerebis in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/130\r\n* Re-structure pipeline by @KateSakharova in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/134\r\n* Fix/virsorter2 by @KateSakharova in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/135\r\n* Feature/support protein predictions by @KateSakharova in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/137\r\n* Add annotations for momofy by @KateSakharova in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/138\r\n* pprmeta mcr cache root by @mberacochea in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/136\r\n* Debug/gff writer by @Ales-ibt in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/140\r\n* Fix/prep release by @KateSakharova in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/142\r\n* Replace hmmscan with hmmsearch by @KateSakharova in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/143\r\n* Prep for the release of version 3.0.0 (or 2.1.0) by @mberacochea in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/139\r\n* A few fixes on v3.0.0 by @mberacochea in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/150\r\n* Prep for release v3.0.1 by @mberacochea in https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/pull/151\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1",
