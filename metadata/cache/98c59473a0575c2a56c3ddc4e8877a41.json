        "description": "<p>Human peer review was an effective technique to address quality, originality, and errors of non-LLM generated work. Researcher-AI trust has since then grown due to performant large language model (LLM) benchmark improvements and author implementations across different model manufacturers for processing frequent, complex, and voluminous data. This single human-AI team has led to the emergence of readily available artificial intelligence peer review. A primary benefit of AI peer review is the ability to appropriately conduct iterative analyses and corrections throughout the entire manuscript process. This responsible method improves on over-worked and fatigued human recommendations provided after manuscript completion. Here, a maximum efficiency study was performed in 14 days with the author utilizing a prior glioblastoma clinical trial matching guidance and a TrialGPT paper as inputs to output a prompt for developing a Python deep learning pipeline. A 10 file dataset and clinical BERT model notebook were generated by Sonnet 4.5 Extended, followed by repetitions of code fixes and optimizations to yield a final notebook at a low test set performance of 67.3%. A triple AI peer review conducted by Sonnet, GPT 5.1, and Grok 4.1 all yielded the primary recommendation to upgrade to a tabular model, which was more suitable for the csv dataset.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT then identified the most appropriate selection: an open source TabPFN-v2-clf model from Hugging Face. The Sonnet recommendations also included detailed instruction for five-fold cross-validation, SHAP explainability, and bias analysis incorporation. An AI peer review evaluation standard for ML workflows based criterion and efficiency metrics was generated by Opus 4.5 with highest efficiencies based on the least number of humans, prompts, and time at the lowest LLM cost. Subsequent evaluation of the current workflow with an overall quality of 87.5%, and 0.831 efficiency based on human, prompt, time, and cost metrics. The ChatGPT identified model and Sonnet review instructions were implemented into the prior notebook to yield a new notebook that saw an acceleration in research progress with a test set accuracy improvement to 94.0% with few-shot learning along with peer review corrections. A regulatory compliance prompt was created, followed by full document generations of FDA 21 CFR Part 820, ICH-GCP E6(R2), and ISO 14971 addressing quality, clinical practice, and risk management. Several attempts to create an effective FastAPI code repository by Sonnet were initially unsuccessful, however an Opus/Sonnet prompting strategy yielded a FastAPI interface with three successful glioblastoma patient clinical trial match predictions. AI as a senior software engineer and as a senior regulatory analyst were also employed as part of the AI peer review process</p>\n<p>The purpose of this AI peer review study was to place the world&rsquo;s focus back on innovating active and real world medical AI advancements in a fraction of the time. Measuring the effect AI implementation has on large workforces can be challenging to quantify. The conversational human-AI R&amp;D relationship has become increasingly solitude: therefore this single author project should be viewed as the standard for new workflows going into the future. This next evolution of peer review is especially suitable for hard working researchers in less favorable economic, educational, and affiliation conditions, such as the author of the paper. This process is afforded by low cost, fast, and easy to use state of the art LLMs from Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI; marking the pivot away from slow and irresponsible use of human peer review for LLM-generated data, and back to fast automation of patient health applications at scale. Many authors of less influence can now improve their speed of development and gain reputation in papers by simply providing prompts, LLMs, AI peer review recommendations, and corrections they made - without the need for paid review or journals. Interested parties can then view the author&rsquo;s peer review findings alongside the paper. Trust for the AI peer review process was established over a series of human-AI works reflected in LLM code and non-code benchmarking, applications in literature, and prior author works using AI in review roles coordinated across judging, external validation, cross-verification, meta-verification, and tests according to FDA/ICH guidance.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Investment in physical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, airports, sea ports, water ports, railways etc., is a fundamental ingredient in the growth and economic development of a country. Compared to countries like Singapore, South Korea and China, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have significantly underinvested in infrastructure over the years, resulting in stunted growth. Zambia, which has a large infrastructure funding gap, and a ballooning government debt, cannot rely solely on the government to meet its infrastructure funding needs. This study looked at establishment of a strategic financing mechanism for sustained construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads- a case of Lusaka district. The study adopted pragmatism philosophy, focusing on practical, real-world outcomes. It combined quantitative and qualitative methods to address establishment of a strategic financing mechanism for sustained construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads (Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2010). A mixed-methods approach was used, integrating both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups) explored strategic mechanism of sustained financing for construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads, while quantitative surveys measured ways of sustaining the financing for construction and maintenance of the public roads This approach provided a comprehensive understanding of how to have a strategic mechanism to fund the construction and maintenance of public roads in Zambia (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2017). The study applied both deductive and inductive approaches. Data collected was analysed using the Dedose Software for the qualitative part and for the quantitative part a thematic analysis was used to come up with the results. Zambia has in place legal and institutional frameworks (Tembo, 2015) that are necessary for effective and efficient road asset management. This study established that a number of financing strategies or frame works for road construction and maintenance such as RoadSIP 1 and II and RoadSIP III (yet to be launched), performed fairly well albeit some challenges. It also established that most road projects under implementation are under the government&rsquo;s balance sheet and that, the Road sector&rsquo;s indebtedness to local Contractors and Consultants was increasing and the financing gap was widening. Zambia would need to spend an average of $1.6 billion a year over the decade 2022&ndash;30 to develop the infrastructure found in the rest of the developing world (Foster and Dominguez, 2010). To close this financial gap required raising more funds and looking for more effective ways to meet infrastructure targets. The study established that since traditional funding methods for road construction and maintenance in Zambia such as tax revenues and loans are becoming unsustainable, there is need to look for other alternatives. The study established the potential strategic sources of funding for sustained construction and maintenance of Zambia&rsquo;s public roads include public private partnerships, equity financing, road tolls and establishment of a State Infrastructure Bank(s). The study also established a Strategic Road Financing Framework (SRFFW) that clearly illustrates the interconnection between institutional governance, revenue diversification, community engagement, and sustainability. To Address financing challenges, it was recommended that there is need to increase Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) by inviting the private sector to participate in the construction, maintenance, and financing of roads.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em><span lang=\"EN\">Phishing sites still cause big problems online, often resulting in stolen money, leaked info, or fake identities being created. Older detection methods use only machine learning or fixed rules, which makes them less accurate and slow during live use. Instead, this study introduces a mixed approach combining smart algorithms with practical URL checks that work instantly. The system tests five types - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, along with K-Nearest Neighbors - using a known public set of phishing links. A quick heuristic tool checks URL structure - then an advanced mix layer decides the outcome. Tests show this combined method beats single models by being more accurate and stable. On top of that, a live web app built with Streamlit lets users test any URL, complete with confidence levels and clear feature insights. The project boosts clarity, real-world use, and trust in spotting today's phishing attempts.</span></em></p>",

In modern engineering geodesy, it plays a crucial role in analyzing both planned and existing geodetic networks as well as in verifying their congruence. Beside the coordinates of a network, the method provides the dispersion of the estimated parameters and essential quantities for quality evaluation.</p>\n<p>At the <em>21th International Course on Engineering Surveying</em>, the principles of geodetic network adjustment are recapitulated within the specific tutorial named <em>network analysis</em>. The conference will be held at TU Graz from February 10 to 13, 2026 - save the date. The network analysis tutorial offers a practical introduction to the fundamentals of adjustment calculations. Through guided case studies, participants will explore how adjustment methods work and gain a deeper understanding of the key parameters involved. Based on this knowledge, the congruence of networks is evaluated within the framework of deformation analysis. Moreover, the tutorial demonstrates how the adjustment results can be integrated into existing workflows and further processed. For the practical part, the powerful open source least-squares software package Java\u00b7Applied\u00b7Geodesy\u00b73D is used.</p>\n<p>Join fellow users, get hands-on experience with JAG3D, get directly in touch with the developer, and expand your professional network during the <a href=\"https://ingenieurvermessungskurs.com/\">Course on Engineering Surveying</a>.

        "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is predicated on the establishment of a causal relationship between endogenous and exogenous latent variables by measuring them with the help of indicators. These causal relationships, established on the basis of extant literature, are represented by a proposed research model, and hypotheses are designed and tested simultaneously. This method is usually analysed using covariance-based (CB-SEM) and variance-based (PLS-SEM) approaches. In numerous academic studies, the dominant approach for fitting and hypothesis testing of research models describing the relationships between latent variables has been the use of LISREL and AMOS software for covariance-based structural equation modelling. In recent years, there has been increase in the number of papers in which SEM analyses are performed with the PLS-SEM approach compared to CB-SEM. The present study commences with a discussion of CB-SEM and PLS-SEM, followed by the provision of straightforward and pragmatic guidance on the presentation of results in the context of PLS-SEM analysis, which constitutes the primary focus of the study. The paper initiates with an examination of the rationale behind the utilisation of PLS-SEM, subsequently offering a concise overview of the fundamental principles for the reporting of PLS-SEM outcomes. The paper also provides a brief overview of the basic concepts of sample size, assumptions, model predictive power, Importance-Performance Map (IPMA) and moderating in PLS-SEM.</span></p>",

        "description": "<p>Domestic robots frequently fail to navigate and adapt in complex home environments, leading to reduced reliability and increased user intervention. We introduce an integrated spatial computing architecture that combines multi-modal sensor fusion with semantic mapping to achieve a 94% success rate in dynamic obstacle avoidance and 95% coverage accuracy in household navigation. Our system demonstrates breakthrough capabilities in real-time environmental adaptation through a novel three-tier processing pipeline: enhanced sensor fusion that maintains position accuracy within 1.8 centimeters, semantic-aware mapping that reduces computational overhead by 76%, and context-driven navigation that decreases user intervention requirements by 78%. The implementation results show sustained performance across varying lighting conditions, with response times averaging 85 milliseconds and operational reliability reaching 99.2% under normal household conditions. These advances in spatial computing capabilities enable autonomous robots to operate more effectively in dynamic domestic settings while maintaining robust performance across diverse environmental challenges.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>HERALD: High-resolution Early Recognition of Antigenic Landscape Divergence</strong></p>\n<p>A theoretical framework for geometry-based viral surveillance that enables early detection of immune-escape variants before widespread transmission. HERALD constructs a Riemannian pullback manifold where Euclidean distances in latent space approximate antigenic relationships within bounded-distortion regimes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>This deposit includes:</strong></p>\n<p>* Complete theoretical framework (manuscript)<br>* Empirical validation studies on SARS-CoV-2 data:<br>&nbsp; - Validation I (DMS): Demonstrates 5.7&ndash;8.8&times; improvement in geometric separation over baseline methods on deep mutational scanning escape data across multiple antibody conditions<br>&nbsp; - Validation II-A (Time Traveler): Retrospective time-slice replay on Nextstrain genomic surveillance data; frozen encoder trained only on 2020 DMS data detects Omicron BA.1 emergence in South Africa (Z = 2.29, p &asymp; 0.011) with near-zero support-adjusted latency<br>&nbsp; - Validation II-B (Instrument Integrity): Audits structural soundness of the HERALD instrument&mdash;confirms PIT-normalized drift scores behave as calibrated Z-scores, validates threshold selection via synthetic Design Frontier analysis, and demonstrates geometric fidelity via Hamming stress test (r &gt; 0.99 linearity up to 30 mutations)<br>* Frozen encoder checkpoint (herald_dms_encoder.pt) for reproducibility<br>* Validation code, results CSVs, and visualization plots (distance histograms, traffic-light heatmaps, Design Frontier curves, manifold smoothness plots)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Contributions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Manifold Construction</strong>: Defines a contrastive learning objective with Jacobian/Laplacian regularization that induces smooth pullback metrics, enabling Euclidean computations to approximate geodesic distances reflecting antigenic divergence</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Real-Time Drift Detection</strong>: Specifies a probability-integral transform (PIT) fusion scheme combining sequence, antigenic, and structural signals into a scalar drift statistic with O(log n) amortized complexity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Formal Guarantees</strong>: Derives margin-to-separation results for InfoNCE objectives and establishes Cantelli-based probability bounds requiring only finite variance (no sub-Gaussian assumptions), composing into conditional end-to-end dominance bounds with explicit error budgets</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Protocols</strong>: Provides falsifiable protocols for retrospective time-slice replay, prospective streaming emulation, distortion audits, and equity/parity analysis across pathogens (SARS-CoV-2, influenza, HIV)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ethics Framework</strong>: Includes comprehensive governance templates addressing dual-use risks, information hazards, data sovereignty, abstention policies, and oversight structures</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Empirical Validation:</strong> Validation I demonstrates 5.7&ndash;8.8&times; improvement in geometric separation (&Delta;) over baseline methods on SARS-CoV-2 deep mutational scanning data. Validation II confirms out-of-time generalization: the frozen encoder detects Omicron BA.1 emergence in South Africa (Z = 2.29, p &asymp; 0.011) under sparse monthly surveillance data with near-zero support-adjusted latency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scope</strong>: The theoretical manuscript presents definitions, assumptions, theorems, and evaluation protocols. Validation I provides empirical confirmation on historical DMS data; Validation II demonstrates real-world surveillance applicability via retrospective time-slice replay on Nextstrain genomic data. Both studies use rigorous train/test methodology and no sequence optimization (safe surveillance scope). Applications extend beyond viral surveillance to bacterial pathogen monitoring (STEC, antibiotic resistance) where antigenic/functional divergence precedes clinical detection.</p>\n<p><strong>Author</strong>: Bee Rosa Davis (NASA Mission Systems Engineer, IBM X-Force Red Principal Adversarial Intelligence Engineer)</p>\n<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: viral surveillance, Riemannian geometry, contrastive learning, immune escape, early warning systems, algorithmic epidemiology, information geometry, public health AI, ESM-2, protein language models, deep mutational scanning</p>\n<p><strong>License and Patent Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Copyright License</strong>:</em> This work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
