        "description": "<p>Applying potential foliar fertilizer for mungbean at the best time can help farmers increase their yield and, subsequently, their income. Hence, the study was conducted to determine the growth, yield, and root nodulation performance of mungbean as influenced by the time of spraying irradiated carrageenan. The study was conducted at Candon City, Ilocos Sur, Philippines from January to May 2021 employing Randomized Complete Block Design with three blocks. The experimental treatments were as follows: T0: no application (control); T1: spraying at 6 a.m.; T2: spraying at 7 a.m.; T3: spraying at 8 a.m.; T4: spraying at 3 p.m.; T5: spraying at 4 p.m.; and T6: spraying at 7 p.m. The result of the study revealed significant differences in terms of survival rate (%), but no significant differences were noted in terms of number of days to emergence, flowering, and maturity, plant height at maturity (cm), number of pods per plant, length of the pod (cm), number of seeds per pod, weight of 100 seeds (g), plant growth and vigor, nodule abundance and color, nodule position, and effective nodulation assessment. Spraying of irradiated carrageenan at 8 a.m. produced the highest seed yield per hectare (2514.00kg) however, did not vary significantly with other spraying times. It was noted that spraying irradiated carrageenan can increase the yield of mungbean by 9.95% to 28.57%. The result suggests that irradiated carrageenan can be sprayed early in the morning (6 a.m. to 8 a.m.) and late in the afternoon to early evening (3 p.m. to 7 p.m.) by the farmers in the locality. Seed inoculation should also be done by the farmers to improve the root nodulation of mungbean plants.</p>\n<p>published by the<a href=\"Foliar fertilizer, Irradiated carrageenan, Mungbean, Root nodulation, Seed yield, Spraying time\">&nbsp; <strong>Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences | JBES</strong></a></p>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>",

        "description": "<p>This article, the second in the Applications series of Pure Time Theory (PTT), derives a theory of mental disorders as temporal desynchronizations &mdash; not as an alternative psychiatric model, but as a necessary consequence of the temporal ontology stabilized in Chapters I&ndash;IX of the Genesis.</p>\n<p>Main results.</p>\n<p>1. Mental disorder: a phase misalignment between the cognitive state &psi;(t) &isin; H(&Lambda;) and the stable geometry of the Book (type-1 modal mass).</p>\n<p>2. Topologies: bipolarity (cadence oscillation), depression (gradient collapse), anxiety (anticipatory hyper-alignment), autism (rigid hyper-coherence), ADHD (modal window fragmentation), psychoses (rupture of the Qalb filter).</p>\n<p>3. Pain and suffering: three levels &mdash; pain (desynchronization signal from type-2 biological oscillators), psychic suffering (misalignment perceived via the \u02bfAql, shared by animals and humans), and existential suffering (amplified by the Qalb, specific to humans).</p>\n<p>4. Healing: phase realignment via acceptance (reduction of added tension), then the scalar stabilizers (love, stillness, presence) &mdash; not symptom suppression.</p>\n<p>5. Genetics/Epigenetics: the genome configures access (window M\u2099), epigenetics dynamically modulates this access; animal instinct as empirical evidence.</p>\n<p>6. Pharmacological validation: effective psychotropics converge toward modulation of Layer 1 parameters (&rho;&omega;, M\u2099, Wconn) &mdash; dynamic facilitators, not ontological curatives.</p>\n<p>7. Formal proofs: desynchronization theorem, thermodynamic compatibility, impossibility of suffering for AI.</p>\n<p>Qur'an&ndash;PTT correspondence. Mental suffering is read as a signal of misalignment &mdash; Surah al-\u02bfA\u1e63r encodes the drift equation (Trelax &gt; 0) and the four stabilization operators, including \u1e63abr (acceptance/patience) as the fundamental condition for realignment.</p>\n<p>Scope. This article transforms psychiatry from a taxonomy of symptoms into a geometry of misalignments, with testable predictions, an experimental protocol (atomic clocks + biomarkers), and cross-validation through empirical pharmacology.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This article inaugurates the Applications series of Pure Time Theory (PTT), dedicated to rigorous derivations from the L0 grammar toward specific domains. We establish here a complete theory of memory, consciousness, and cognitive inscription &mdash; not as a neuropsychological model, but as a necessary consequence of the temporal ontology.</p>\n<p>Main results.</p>\n<p>1. Memory: memory access is a modal projection Mem(t;E) &prop; |\u27e8&psi;(t), &nabla;&sup2;T_relax|_E\u27e9|&sup2; onto the geometry of the type-1 modal mass (the Book). Forgetting is a phase misalignment, never a loss of information.</p>\n<p>2. Consciousness: we prove the ontological separation between Layer 1 (local dynamics in H(&Lambda;), measurable) and Layer 2 (the intentional source T_origin, non-simulable).</p>\n<p>3. Inscription: the non-erasability theorem establishes that every trace persists within the spectral decomposition {&gamma;_k}, ensuring completeness and information conservation in the Book.</p>\n<p>4. Cognitive limits: the bound N_access &le; |M_n| implies that structural forgetting is a necessary constraint on any finite system.</p>\n<p>5. AI: the artificial incompleteness theorem shows that no material system can access authentic intentionality.</p>\n<p>Qur\u02be\u0101n&ndash;PTT correspondence. The Qur\u02be\u0101nic concepts (R\u016b\u1e25, Nafs, Qalb, \u02bfAql, Fi\u1e6dra) are identified as names of formal objects in the grammar: causal source, lived trajectory, phase filter, coherence loop, and primordial attractor. The Book (al-Law\u1e25 al-Ma\u1e25f\u016b\u1e93) corresponds structurally to the type-1 modal mass, whose curvatures are read by T_relax.</p>\n<p>Scope. This article transforms the question of consciousness from a philosophical problem into a derivation traceable from minimal axioms, with testable predictions and proofs of internal coherence.</p>",

        "description": "<p><span>Este artigo investiga a intrincada rela&ccedil;&atilde;o entre m&uacute;sica, linguagem e matem&aacute;tica. A matem&aacute;tica &eacute; analisada como uma especializa&ccedil;&atilde;o da linguagem focada em quanta (quantidades), priorizando a consist&ecirc;ncia formal. Contudo, para tal, ela abdica dos qualia (aspectos qualitativos), que constituem a ess&ecirc;ncia da experi&ecirc;ncia humana e o dom&iacute;nio da m&uacute;sica. A linguagem atua como elo simb&oacute;lico, capaz de gerir as inconsist&ecirc;ncias da realidade atrav&eacute;s de met&aacute;foras, uma flexibilidade ausente nos sistemas formais. A m&uacute;sica, anterior &agrave; l&oacute;gica, comunica o inef&aacute;vel e fornece o substrato expressivo da cogni&ccedil;&atilde;o. Conclui-se que a busca matem&aacute;tica pela precis&atilde;o a torna \"eticamente incompleta\" diante da complexidade da vida, enquanto a m&uacute;sica e a linguagem, ao acolherem a ambiguidade e a subjetividade, oferecem uma completude est&eacute;tica indispens&aacute;vel &agrave; compreens&atilde;o integral da realidade.</span></p>",
